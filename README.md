Magma code related to PhD thesis and related research.

"SubstructureParabolics.mg" contains some useful functions for working with groups of Lie type in Magma.

"CayleyAlgebraSheafHomology.mg" contains functions to create in Magma the Cayley algebra, the group $G=G_2(F)$, its associated generalised hexagon and to compute the dimension of the sheaf homology module $H_0(\Delta,\mathscr{F}_{C})$, where $\Delta$ is the building of $G$ and $C$ is the 7-dimensional Cayley module for $G$.
